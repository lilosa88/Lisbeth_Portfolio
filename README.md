# [Project 1: Case study of the survival rate in Titanic:](https://github.com/lilosa88/Titanic)

-The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. This project that is part of kaggle's competitions has as objective to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

- From data exploration we found that women and kids had more chances to survive. As well, the class ticket played a role, being the 1st class the onces with more chances to survive. The age and the place of embarking was decisive for the suvival for mens. People that travel with 1 or 3 people than 0 or more than 3, had more chances to survive.

- Different Classification Machine Learning model and Deep Learning model were used in oder to predict the survival of passengers aboard Titanic. Among the classification ML we used Random Forest, Logistic Regression and KNN.

- The best accuracy (0.86) was obtained from Deep Learning Model, which was conformed by Sequential and Dropouts layers. 


# [Project 2: Case study of the Diabetes rate](https://github.com/lilosa88/Diabetes)
- Create a model using machine learning techiniques in order to predicts which patient has/has not diabetes.

# [Project 3: Case study to predict final prices of houses in Iowa:](https://github.com/lilosa88/PricingHouse)
- With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, create a model to predict the final price of each home.

# [Project 4: Prediction of Sunspots:](https://github.com/lilosa88/Sunspots)
- Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. Create a model to predict the number of suspots.

# [Project 5:Digit Recognition:](https://github.com/lilosa88/DigitRecognizion)
- MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

- Create a model that correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
