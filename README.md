# [Project 1: Case study of the survival rate in Titanic:Project Overview](https://github.com/lilosa88/Data-Science-Portafolio-/tree/lilosa88-TITANIC)
- Create a model using machine learning techiniques in order to predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
- Train/Test data was used in order to train and evaluate the efficiency of the model.

# [Project 2: Case study of the Diabetes rate](https://github.com/lilosa88/Data-Science-Portafolio-/tree/lilosa88-Diabetes)
- Create a model using machine learning techiniques in order to predicts which patient has/has not diabetes.

# [Project 3: Case study to predict final prices of houses in Iowa:Project Overview](https://github.com/lilosa88/Data-Science-Portafolio-/tree/lilosa88-PricingHouse)
- With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, create a model to predict the final price of each home.

# [Project 4: Prediction of Sunspots:Project Overview](https://github.com/lilosa88/Data-Science-Portafolio-/tree/lilosa88-Sunspots)
- Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. Create a model to predict the number of suspots.

# [Project 5:Digit Recognition:Project Overview](https://github.com/lilosa88/Data-Science-Portafolio-/tree/lilosa88-DigitRecognizion)
- MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

- Create a model that correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
